# Promises example in Javascript

The example you need to see is under `/js/test/promises.js` and
`/js/lib/promises.js`. There's a commented `debugger` statement to help you get
to the exact point.

Check `index.html` for a working implementation of the promise.

## How to run the app

```
$ python -m SimpleHTTPServer
```

Python version should be `2.x.`.
